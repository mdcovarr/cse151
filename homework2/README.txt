For problem 3 we were able to implement KNN.java which determines the Validation
error and the Training error. Validation error was determines by setting the
parameter vec2 = valid_data, and Training error was determined by setting the
parameter vec2 = train_data.

projectionKNN.java was an attempt to complete part (b) of problem 3 but does not
compile at the moment. although the logic was not too difficult, we were short
on time and were not able to implement a functioning program. The issue we faced
was developing a similar algorithm but not with reading in values of type double
instead of integers since there was an introduction of negative decimal values
