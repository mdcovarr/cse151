Run Code 
1 - python boost.py 

Code output is the running values for rounds t = 1 to t = 20 
we have as output:
e_t (epsilon error at time t)
alpha_t (alpha value at time t)
h_t (the location of the word classifier in the dictionary)
z_t (the determine variable used to normalize the weight)
error (The total test error for the given round t)
