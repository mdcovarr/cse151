Problem 4)
For Problem 4 we successfully determine the correct cutValue (cut value = 0.5) amongst 
feature 5 to be the optimal solution in cutting the root node. However when continung the 
algorithm we were not able to successfully create the whole decision tree which due to time 
complexity. There was no issue min determining the entropy of a node, as well as the conditional 
entropy for the cut value threshold and feature with the lowest entropy. However we ran into 
difficulty when creating the tree, thus preventing us from being able to correctly 
traverse down the tree and determine the training error.
